# How to Fix Hero Slides Issues

Based on the database structure you shared, I've created solutions for the hero slides issues:

## 1. Fix the SQL Script Errors

The original SQL script was failing because:

1. It was using `image_url` column that existed but was inconsistently defined
2. The `order` column wasn't properly quoted (it's a reserved SQL keyword)

## 2. Use the Fixed SQL Script

I've created `insert_hero_slides_final.sql` which uses the exact column structure from your database. This script:

- Includes all columns found in your schema
- Properly quotes the `order` column
- Uses NULL for optional fields
- Sets direct URLs for images instead of trying to upload

## 3. Fix the Image Deletion in Admin Interface

I've also updated the `removeSlide` function in `HeroConfigPage.tsx` to properly:

- Ask for confirmation before deletion 
- Delete the slide from both local state and the database
- Clean up associated images
- Show a loading spinner during deletion

## 4. Configuration for Storage Bucket

Make sure your storage bucket is configured correctly:

1. Your bucket name is `site_images` (not "images")
2. The bucket has public access enabled
3. Update paths in the code to use this bucket name

## Quick Steps to Get Everything Working

1. Run the `fix_hero_slides_table.sql` script to ensure your table has all needed columns
2. Run the `insert_hero_slides_final.sql` script to add sample hero slides
3. Restart your development server
4. Test the hero slides admin page to ensure you can now delete slides
5. If issues persist with image upload/deletion, check browser console for specific errors

## Fixing Hero Slides Deletion

If hero slide deletion is still not working:

1. Clear browser cache/cookies
2. Check browser console for specific error messages
3. Verify that your Supabase API key has DELETE permissions
4. Test with a fresh hero slide that you add first, then try to delete
